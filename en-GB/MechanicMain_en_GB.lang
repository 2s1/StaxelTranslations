staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000100=Hey, wanna give me a ha-

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000300=I'd shake yer 'and but I don't think ya'd appreciate the oil!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000400=The name's ^c:1486b0;{0-name}^c:pop; though.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000500=If y'ever have any crafting needs, I can help out!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000600=Hmm? Is that yer ^c:d03e37;farm license^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000700=I'm guessin' ^c:1486b0;{0-mayor_name}^c:pop; sent ya about the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; then?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000800=It's a bit of a task, but I figure it'll get ya familiar with workin' around here!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000900=Wonderful work ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001000=That barn almos' brought a tear ta my eye!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001010=If ya haven't been ta see him already, I think ^c:1486b0;{0-mayor_name}^c:pop; would love ta hear about it too!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001020=I hope ta see more o' yer good work around the place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001030=Come back anytime ya need some materials from the store or some advice!

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001200=They come in aaall shapes and sizes. Ya seen the ^c:d03e37;mailboxes^c:pop; around? Same deal.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001300=Jus' shove 'er into the ground-makin' sure ya got the rotation right!-and you'll be on track in no time!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001400=You can take a look at it anytime after that to get an idea of what's missin'!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001500=HOWEVER! And keep this firmly in mind!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001600=That ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; ain't gonna build itself. You gotta do that part yerself.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001700=You'll have ta chop down trees fer ^c:d03e37;wood^c:pop;, turn 'em into blocks, and build it up bit by bit.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001800='Course, ya can always buy some o' the blocks at the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001900=Others parts might be a bit harder to come by...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002000=Now off you trot. Go find a nice spot for that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; and come back to me with some ^c:d03e37;wood^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002100=An ^c:d03e37;axe^c:pop; oughta help out with that!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002200=Once ya have the ^c:d03e37;wood^c:pop; in hand, I'll show ya how ta turn it inta more interestin' things!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002300=Ready ta learn the ways o' the master builder?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002400=It's actually pretty easy!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002500=All ya need is three things: ingredients, a ^c:d03e37;blueprint or recipe^c:pop;, and ^c:d03e37;craftin' stations^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002600=The stations ya need ta get the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; done are all set up in the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop; already.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002700=Feel free ta borrow 'em anytime! Jus' don' try to run off with 'em...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002800=When structures get vandalised... well we ain't gonna be usin' 'em 'till they're fixed.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002900=Yer gonna need some ^c:d03e37;raw wood^c:pop; for this next bit!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003000=Go chop down a few o' them big trees around the village!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003100=So anyway.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003200=This ^c:d03e37;blueprint^c:pop; will show ya how to make the basic ^c:d03e37;trough^c:pop; for the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003300=I suspect ya already know how to make a few more basic blocks though.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003400=Ya need to use the ^c:d03e37;blueprint^c:pop; in order ta memorise it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003500=Then ya can find it again anytime in the blueprint tab of yer inventory.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003600=I'll give ya a moment ta do that. Talk to me again when yer all set!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003700=With that outta the way, it's just a case o' putting the bits and pieces together!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003800=Each step in the ^c:d03e37;blueprint^c:pop; uses a particular type o' ^c:d03e37;craftin' station^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003900=If ya need ta ^c:d03e37;saw^c:pop; somethin', a ^c:d03e37;saw bench^c:pop; will do that for ye!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004000=If ya wanna ^c:d03e37;assemble^c:pop; somethin', an ^c:d03e37;assembly station^c:pop; is the way to go!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004100=Makes sense right?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004120=Ya wanna set the items down on the left side o' the station. The final result ya take from the right!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004140=Interactin' with the middle o' the station will usually set 'er goin'!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004200=These should cover some o' the items needed ta make the ^c:d03e37;trough^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004300=Start by usin' the ^c:d03e37;saw bench^c:pop; in the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop; ta make some ^c:d03e37;lumber^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004400=If memory serves, the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; needs a couple o' ^c:d03e37;troughs^c:pop;, some walls, and a roof.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004500=Once ya have all the parts, go finish off that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004520=I'm sure I don't hafta remind ya how to build a good structure!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004540=Jus' put down some blocks to make four nice walls.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004560=Make sure ya don't forget the door or ya might run inta some problems...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004580=Then cover it over with a solid roof of blocks to keep out the rain!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004585=It really doesn't matter what type o' barn ya build. We don' have a solid blueprint!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004590=Jus' keep most o' the structure inside the glowy bits and it'll be all good!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004600=I'll be waitin' to hear all about it when yer done!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004700=How's that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; goin'?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004800=Makin' good progress?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004900=Come see me with yer ^c:d03e37;farm license^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005000=^c:1486b0;Mayor^c:pop; said ta give a good rundown on buildin' once ya had it.
