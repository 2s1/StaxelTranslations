staxel.mail.RobinIntro.subject=Hey there!
staxel.mail.RobinIntro=Hey there!\n\nCongrats on your new postbox!\n\nThe name's ^c:1486b0;Robin^c:pop; and I'm one of the two designated postmen for your region, here to give you a few tips. I think ^c:1486b0;Wren^c:pop; was going to send you something too, but knowing her she probably got lost trying to deliver it! I'm joking, of course (send help, I think I made her angry)!\n\nYou'll probably get a few letters from time to time, mostly from other residents looking for help or sending you gifts, but sometimes you might get something from out of town! Doesn't matter which postbox you check eitherâ€”we're pretty good at making sure your post is exactly where you need it, when you need it! It's probably a good idea to keep an eye on your mail to make sure you don't miss anything important.\n\nHope to catch you on my rounds someday,\n\n^c:1486b0;Robin^c:pop;
