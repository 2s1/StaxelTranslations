staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000300=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000400=I must say I've been thinking about raising taxes again recently.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000500=We could really use some renovations.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000600=You should see the state of my office.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000700=Not even a single marble column!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000800=Why are they so against opening a new coal mine?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000900=It's not like it would do any real damage to the environment...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001000=Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001100=They tell me the opposition is trying to build a strong following.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001200=Not on my watch!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001300=Oh, is that your Farm Registration Letter?

staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001800=No, not just yet
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001900=Marvelous! Here is your license.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002000=Also here's your reward.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002100=We're all looking forward to seeing the farm revitalised!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002200=As you wish!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002300=You can still turn it in later if you change your mind!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002400=I imagine I'll be seeing you quite often!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002500=Now that you're a fully licensed farmer...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002600=We can finally get those stray cattle off our hands!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002700=But before we can do that, you need to build a barn.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002800=This is a Barn Sign.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002900=Place it in front of where you want to build the barn.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003000=You can use it to see what's missing as you build.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003100=Once it's done, it'll activate the building!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003200=Come and see me after that and we'll get you some cows!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003300=How are you faring at building that barn?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003400=Place the sign in front of where you want to build the barn.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003500=You can use it to see what's missing as you build.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003600=Once it's done, it'll activate the building!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003700=Come and see me after that to get your cattle!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003800=I've been hearing about the fabulous new barn you built!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003900=Sounds like everything is in order.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004000=Here are the few cows we managed to round up.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004100=They all ran away when the previous owner left.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004200=Good luck!
